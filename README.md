Course Description

This Visual Studies workshop borrows ideas and work-flows from the gaming industry, and tests their capacities as tools, mediums and perceptual devices for the production, representation and possible diffusion of architecture into a virtual reality.

Part design investigation, part technical workshop, students will connect standard 3D architectural packages with the Unity gaming development platform and the Oculus Rift Virtual Reality Headset. Through lectures, demos and workshops, students will be provided with the conceptual framing and technical knowledge required to assist them in the production of rich and interactive games that push the conceptual limits of virtual reality.
